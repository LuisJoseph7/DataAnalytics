# Credit Scoring with K-NN and Random Forest

This project focuses on developing a **Credit Scoring model** to predict the probability of default.  
The analysis and modeling were performed using **R in RStudio**.

## Project Highlights

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** – Classification model to predict credit risk based on similarity between clients.  
- **Random Forest** – Ensemble method for more robust and accurate credit scoring.  
- **Credit Risk Insights** – Identify high-risk clients and support better credit decision-making.

## Tools & Libraries

- **R** – Core programming language  
- **RStudio** – Integrated development environment  
- **Caret** – Machine learning framework in R  
- **Dplyr & Tidyverse** – Data manipulation and preprocessing
